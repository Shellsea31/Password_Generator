# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

This weekâ€™s homework required me to generate a random password based on criteria the user has selected. I had starter code to begin with, and added to it by creating a function which ...

1. Prompt and confirm to allow user to decide length of password and types of characters.

2. Variables used to make code concise and more readable.

3. Conditional statements to alert user when input is invalid. Also used in combination with the push() method to combine all possible options based on users criteria. 

4. A while, for loop, and if statement to loop through users character options and select a random value each time. 

5. Return statements to stop the function from running if user does not confirm characters, or return value of new password to the function.

Once the new password had been generated and returned to the function I used the given started code to match the elements in the HTML to the value of said function, therefore displaying it to the screen.

## Requirements 

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
